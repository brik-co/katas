# Stack

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to use test-driven development skills and techniques to build and understand a Stack data structure.
Remember to work iteratively, run the tests often, and refactor when things start to get messy.

## Stack concept

A Stack is a data structure typically used to demonstrate last-in first-out behavior. 

Consider a _stack_ of plates in the kitchen.
When the dishes are clean, the plates are collected one-by-one and placed in the cabinet. The first plate you picked up is on the bottom
while the last one is on top. When someone gets hungry and needs a plate, the top plate is used first.

Other real world applications include undo/redo functionality, symmetry testing (parenthesis algorithm problem), and back/forward buttons in the browser.

## Stack functionality

Here is the functionality of a Stack that needs to be implemented:

`push` - adds an element to the top of the stack

`pop` - removes the topmost element from the stack

`isEmpty` - checks whether the stack is empty

`isFull` - checks whether the stack is full

`top` - displays the topmost element of the stack
